# Backend Deployment Instructions

Follow these steps to deploy the updated backend to Render:

1. Commit your changes to your Git repository:
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Fix CORS issues and improve error handling"
git push
```

2. Log in to your Render account and navigate to your backend service.

3. If you have automatic deployments set up, Render will automatically deploy the latest changes from your repository.

4. If automatic deployments are not set up, click the "Manual Deploy" button and select "Deploy latest commit".

5. Wait for the deployment to complete. You can monitor the deployment logs to ensure everything is working correctly.

6. Once deployed, test the API connection using the test component we added to the home page.

## Troubleshooting

If you still encounter CORS issues after deployment:

1. Check the Render logs for any errors related to CORS.
2. Verify that the frontend is making requests to the correct backend URL.
3. Make sure the backend CORS configuration includes the correct frontend domain.
4. Try clearing your browser cache and reloading the page.
5. Use browser developer tools to inspect the network requests and check for CORS errors.
